pyRouterLib
===========

NOTE: This is still very much a work in progress. Don't expect it to have much functionality at this time.

RouterLib is a python library of commonly used functions for managing routers and switches. The purpose is to stream line the scripting process.

Functions currently being written are:

* Accessing a device via telnet
* Accessing a device via ssh
* Accessing a device via snmp
