pyRouterLib
===========

pyRouterLib is a python library of commonly used functions. The purpose is to stream line the scripting process.

pyMultiChange.py is a script that takes input files for hosts and commands and executes the commands on every host, via SSH. Currently, I haven't written the process for go into 'enable' mode, so it only works for user commands.
